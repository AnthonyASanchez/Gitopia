## Go from where?
What is go, why do we need it and what does it help us accomplish that makes it better than other languages?<br/>
Built in 2007 by some smart engineers @ Google, Go (formally known as Golang) is a modern programming language that has great features such as:
- Type Inference
- Pointer Arithmetic
- Method and Operator Overloading 

These will be explained below but first, why? Why did the smart engineers feel the need to create Go!?<br/>
### Why?
We claimed it was a law, that [Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) was right and would always be right. But unfortunately Moore's law was not so much as a law as it was a trend. But since the early 2000's hardware has stopped drastically increasing in speed. So, with know where left to turn some people decided to Go! and make a new language. Hoping to increase software efficiency to keep up with the demanding speeds of the 21st century.

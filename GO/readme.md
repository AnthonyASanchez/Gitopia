## Go from where?
What is go, why do we need it and what does it help us accomplish that makes it better than other languages?<br/>
Built in 2007 by some smart engineers @ Google, Go (formally known as Golang) is a modern programming language that has great features such as:
- Goroutines
- Type Inference
- Pointer Arithmetic
- Garbage collection
- Method and Operator Overloading 

These will be explained below but first, why? Why did the smart engineers feel the need to create Go!?<br/>
### Why?
We claimed it was a law, that [Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) was right and would always be right. But unfortunately Moore's law was not so much as a law as it was a trend. But since the early 2000's hardware has stopped drastically increasing in speed. So, with know where left to turn some people decided to Go! and make a new language. Hoping to increase software efficiency to keep up with the demanding speeds of the 21st century.<br/>
### What makes it better
In a distributed world we need a distributed minded language. Other languages such as C++, Java, Python were never built for concurrency. They have concurrency as features with multithreading interfaces,etc.. but they did not have concurrency in mind when they built the language. This is where Go's goroutines come in handy (will be explained below).<br/>
